# STATE — 工地控制系統 Milestone

**Last updated:** 2026-05-14 (Phase 2 Plan 02-03 complete; native plugins + zh-HK permissions + cap sync clean)

## Project Reference

- **Project:** CK工程 / Construction App (live on iOS App Store; Android in test)
- **Core value:** 判頭 + 工地主任 always know exactly what's happening on every site, with a shared audit trail that survives disputes.
- **Current milestone:** 工地控制系統 (Site Control System) — 3 coarse phases
- **Current focus:** Phase 2 — SI / VO (Site Instructions / Variation Orders)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (SI/VO) — EXECUTING (Wave 2 complete; Wave 3 = Plan 02-04 next)
Plan: 3 of 9

- **Phase:** 2 — SI / VO (Site Instructions / Variation Orders)
- **Plan:** 02-01 + 02-02 + 02-03 ✅ complete. Wave 3 next = 02-04 (TS types + SiContext + submit_approval RPC), depends on 02-02 (SI schema live).
- **Status:** EXECUTING
- **Progress:** Phase 1 [██████████] 100% · Phase 2 [███░░░░░░░] 33% (3/9) · Phase 3 not yet planned · Overall [███████░░░] 67%

### Critical apply-tooling note (captured 02-02)

PowerShell `Set-Clipboard` + `Get-Content -Raw` corrupts UTF-8 multi-byte chars (CP950 reinterpretation) on Windows. **Always** apply non-ASCII SQL via base64 → Monaco `setValue` (Chrome MCP `javascript_tool`) instead of clipboard. See 02-02-SUMMARY.md for details. Hot-fix path documented.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **3 coarse phases, user-fixed** — milestone breaks into exactly Drawings → SI/VO → PTW. No invented sub-phases.
- **Phase ordering: Drawings → SI/VO → PTW.** Drawings is smallest and unblocks SI/VO inline references; PTW is most domain-heavy and reuses Phase 2 chain infra.
- **Approval-chain infrastructure built in Phase 2.** Even though PTW reuses it, the `project_approval_chains` table, admin UI, and append-only `approvals` log are introduced in Phase 2 with PTW already supported as a `doc_type`. Phase 3 seeds chain rows only.
- **Cross-cutting INF items established in Phase 1.** Migration namespace `v8-`, private-bucket template, RLS helpers, demo_feedback RLS fix, bundle-split + CI guard, Chinese-strings convention.
- **INF-08 (Playwright smoke tests) is cross-phase** — each phase ships its own happy-path test (DRW upload+view in P1, SI submit+approve in P2, PTW submit+sign+activate in P3).
- **safety_officer role lands inside Phase 3** (touches live `user_profiles` CHECK + `delete_my_account` RPC — Apple compliance must be preserved).
- **Phase 3 opens with a 1–2 day de-risking spike** (signed-JWT QR, pg_cron expiry, new native plugin, Apple re-review framing).

### Open Todos

- [ ] `/gsd-execute-phase 2` to ship SI/VO (9 plans, 8 waves)
- [ ] Plan Phase 3 (PTW) — open with 1–2 day de-risking spike
- [ ] Confirm production admin password `admin1234` rotation status
- [ ] Clean up untracked screenshots + `test-results/` at repo root before Phase 2 execution muddies the diff

### Blockers

None.

### Risks Carried Forward (from research)

- C1 storage RLS bypass via `getPublicUrl` reflex (mitigate in P1)
- C6 RLS recursive-policy meltdown (mitigate in P1 via `security definer set search_path = public` + `rls-smoke.sql`)
- C4 chain user-departure deadlock (mitigate in P2 via role+delegation model)
- C5 MC silently editing subcon SI (mitigate in P2 via `with check (false)` + versioned edits)
- C2 QR screenshot abuse (mitigate in P3 via signed JWT + login-gated verification)
- C3 Apple re-review on PTW copy (mitigate in P3 via `app_config.ptw_enabled` flag + framing)
- M6 bundle bloat (mitigate in P1 via `manualChunks` + CI guard)

## Session Continuity

**Last action:** Plan 02-03 complete — installed @capacitor/geolocation@8.2.0 + capacitor-voice-recorder@7.0.6 + diff-match-patch@1.0.5; added zh-HK NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription + NSMicrophoneUsageDescription (replaced video-capture copy) + ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION + RECORD_AUDIO; npx cap sync clean for both platforms; tsc + bundle CI guard green (entry 507.6 KB). Manual Xcode/Android Studio build checkpoint (Task 5) deferred — autonomous run.
**Next action:** Plan 02-04 (Wave 3) — TS types + SiContext + submit_approval RPC. Depends only on 02-02 SI schema (live) — diff-match-patch is now ready for diff utilities.
